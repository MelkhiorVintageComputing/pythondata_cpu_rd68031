// RD68031 -- the divider: 64 by 32, which every form of DIVU and DIVS reduces to.
//
// PRM 4 gives DIVS and DIVU four shapes each:
//
//     DIVx.W  <ea>,Dn      32 / 16 -> 16 quotient in the low word,
//                                     16 remainder in the high word
//     DIVx.L  <ea>,Dq      32 / 32 -> 32 quotient, remainder discarded
//     DIVx.L  <ea>,Dr:Dq   64 / 32 -> 32 quotient and 32 remainder
//     DIVxL.L <ea>,Dr:Dq   32 / 32 -> 32 quotient and 32 remainder
//
// All four are this one unit: the caller widens its dividend to 64 bits and its
// divisor to 32, and checks afterwards that the quotient fits where it is going.
//
// Signed division is done on magnitudes and the signs put back. PRM 4: "the sign
// of the remainder is the same as the sign of the dividend", which is the rule
// C99 chose too and not the one a floor division would give.
//
// Restoring division, one quotient bit per clock, 32 clocks. The sequencer
// stalls on `busy` exactly as it stalls on a bus cycle, so the instruction
// timing falls out of the structure rather than being designed --
// doc/timing-divergences.md measures it against UM20 section 8.
